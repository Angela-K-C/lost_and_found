## 🧨 Problem

Every day, students on campus lose belongings like books, bottles, school IDs, and more. Although a Lost and Found office exists, many are unaware of its location, resulting in:

* Lost items going unclaimed
* Increased workload for staff
* Crowded and disorganized Lost and Found offices
* Permanent loss of student property

---

## 💡 Solution

This platform offers a **simple, 24/7 accessible website** that allows students and staff to:

* Report lost or found items online
* View and search listings of reported items
* Get directions to the physical Lost and Found office
* Receive notifications when potential matches are found

This streamlines the Lost and Found process, enhances transparency, and reduces congestion at physical offices.
